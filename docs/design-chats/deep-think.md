# Agentic Chat: Key Design Ideas and Minimal Implementation Details

Below are concise, implementation-ready design ideas to extend a single “chat → one vector DB query” flow into an agentic, iterative system that can reason about when and how to retrieve, with bounded autonomy. Each bullet is scoped to be easy to slot into an existing codebase (e.g., Cursor), while leaving room for your own assumptions and abstractions.

## Core Agent Loop

- Control loop: plan → act (tool) → observe → reflect → decide stop/continue, capped by max_iterations and a confidence threshold.[1][2][3]
- Make retrieval conditional: only call retrievers when the LLM signals insufficient context or low confidence, not every turn.[4][2]
- Interleave reasoning with retrieval rather than a single pre-retrieval step; allow multiple hops and query reformulations.[5][6][4]

## Decision Policy

- Confidence gating: model returns a scalar confidence in “answerability” and “grounding sufficiency”; continue iterating if below threshold.[2][3]
- Stop conditions: max_iterations reached, confidence ≥ threshold, or marginal utility check (new retrieval adds = cfg.conf_threshold:
            reflect = llm.reflect(draft, evidence)
            if not reflect.needs_more:
                return finalize(draft, evidence)

    # Fallback: best draft with caveats
    return finalize(state.best_draft(), state.best_evidence())
```


## How to Extend Your Current “Chat → Vector DB” Flow

- Add a planner step before retrieval to decide if retrieval is needed and which type (vector vs. keyword vs. web) with a max_iterations loop.[3][4][5]
- Implement query rewriting and hybrid retrieval; keep your current vector DB as the first-line tool, add a simple keyword/BM25 and optional web/API tool.[7][4][5]
- Insert a reflection pass after synthesis to validate coverage and citations; only iterate if reflection flags gaps.[8][3]
- Track confidence and novelty to stop early; wire in tunable thresholds and a hard iteration cap.[2][3]

These patterns mirror modern “agentic RAG” systems that interleave reasoning and retrieval with bounded autonomy and explicit validation, improving accuracy and adaptability over single-pass RAG while keeping implementation surface area small.[4][5][3]
