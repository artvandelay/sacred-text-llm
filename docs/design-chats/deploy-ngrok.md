## Detailed Tech Spec for Option 1: Local Hosting with Ngrok Exposure

Hey, bootstrapper! Awesome, let's dive deep into Option 1. As a hacker who's tested countless prototypes this way (literally exposing local apps to beta users while sipping coffee on my Mac), I get the appealâ€”it's dead simple, zero-cost for starters, and perfect for your 30M-word sacred texts LLM agent. Since you mentioned not giving all the context (e.g., exact details on your ChromaDB setup, Claude framework integration, or app structure), I'll provide options where things could vary. I'll assume a typical Python-based setup (common for ChromaDB and LLM agents), but flag alternatives if you're using something else like Node.js or a different stack.

This spec is designed as a step-by-step blueprint you can copy-paste into Cursor (or whatever IDE you're using) to build/refine. It covers setup, persistence, security, exposure, testing, and scaling notes for your 10-20 users. Goal: Get a public URL up in under 30 minutes, with your agent queryable via API or a basic web interface.

### 1. System Requirements
- **Hardware/OS**: macOS (you're already on a Macâ€” Ventura or later recommended for Docker stability). At least 8GB RAM (your 30M-word DB will chew memory; 16GB+ ideal for smooth querying).
- **Software**:
  - Python 3.10+ (for ChromaDB and LLM libs).
  - Docker Desktop (free for personal use; install via brew: `brew install --cask docker` if not already).
  - Ngrok (free tier; install: `brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok`).
  - Optional: Homebrew for easy installs (`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`).
- **Dependencies** (based on your prototype):
  - ChromaDB: `pip install chromadb` (or via Docker image).
  - LLM Framework: Assuming Anthropic's Claude API or a local model (e.g., via Ollama). If you're using LangChain/LlamaIndex for the "deep research" flow, install those: `pip install langchain anthropic`.
  - Web Server: FastAPI or Flask for exposing the agent (e.g., `pip install fastapi uvicorn` for a quick API).

If your setup differs (e.g., no Python, or using a different vector DB like Pinecone locally), swap in equivalentsâ€”let me know for tweaks.

### 2. Architecture Overview
- **Core Components**:
  - **Vector DB (ChromaDB)**: Stores your scraped 30M-word embeddings. Runs in Docker for isolation and persistence.
  - **LLM Agent**: Your Claude-style deep research framework. This could be a Python script that queries ChromaDB, processes lateral explorations (e.g., semantic search across sacred texts), and generates responses.
  - **Web Interface/API**: A simple server to handle user queries (e.g., POST requests with a query string, returning JSON responses like {"response": "Direct quote from text X with analysis"}).
  - **Exposure**: Ngrok tunnels your local port to a public HTTPS URL.
- **Data Flow**:
  1. User hits the public Ngrok URL with a query (e.g., "Explore karma in Hindu vs. Buddhist texts").
  2. Web server receives it, queries ChromaDB for relevant embeddings.
  3. Agent processes (e.g., retrieves passages, applies deep research logic like chain-of-thought or multi-step reasoning).
  4. Response sent back.
- **Assumptions/Options**: If your prototype is CLI-only, we'll add a web wrapper. If it's already web-enabled (e.g., via Streamlit), expose that port directly.

### 3. Step-by-Step Setup
#### Step 3.1: Prepare ChromaDB with Persistence
Your DB needs to survive restartsâ€”use Docker for this.

- **Option A: Run ChromaDB in Docker (Recommended for Stability)**:
  ```bash
  # Create a local directory for persistence
  mkdir -p ~/chroma-data

  # Run ChromaDB Docker container with volume mount
  docker run -d --name chroma-server \
    -p 8000:8000 \  # Local port; change if conflicting
    -v ~/chroma-data:/chroma/chroma \  # Persists data here
    -e CHROMA_SERVER_AUTH_PROVIDER=chromadb.auth.token.TokenAuthServerProvider \
    -e CHROMA_SERVER_AUTH_CREDENTIALS="your-secret-token" \  # For basic auth
    ghcr.io/chroma-core/chroma:latest
  ```
  - This exposes Chroma on http://localhost:8000. Upload your 30M-word embeddings if not already (use Chroma Python client: `client = chromadb.HttpClient(host='localhost', port=8000)`).

- **Option B: Run Locally Without Docker** (If Docker Feels Heavy):
  Install `chromadb` via pip, then in your Python script:
  ```python
  import chromadb
  client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="~/chroma-data")  # Persists to disk
  # Add your collections here
  ```
  But Docker is better for production-like testing.

#### Step 3.2: Build/Wrap Your LLM Agent
Assuming your prototype is a Python script (e.g., `agent.py`), wrap it in a web API.

- **Using FastAPI (Lightweight and Async-Friendly)**:
  Create `app.py`:
  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  import chromadb  # Or your client setup
  from anthropic import Anthropic  # If using Claude API; swap for your framework

  app = FastAPI()
  chroma_client = chromadb.HttpClient(host="localhost", port=8000)  # Connect to DB
  anthropic_client = Anthropic(api_key="your-anthropic-api-key")  # Or local model

  class Query(BaseModel):
      text: str

  @app.post("/query")
  async def query_agent(query: Query):
      try:
          # Your deep research logic here (simplified example)
          collection = chroma_client.get_collection("sacred-texts")
          results = collection.query(query_texts=[query.text], n_results=5)
          # Process with Claude-style reasoning
          response = anthropic_client.messages.create(
              model="claude-3-opus-20240229",  # Or your model
              max_tokens=1000,
              messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Deep research on: {query.text} using: {results}"}]
          )
          return {"response": response.content[0].text}
      except Exception as e:
          raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      import uvicorn
      uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001)  # Port for the app
  ```
  - Run: `python app.py` (exposes on http://localhost:8001).
  - **Options**: If your framework is Streamlit, run `streamlit run your_app.py` on port 8501. For no-code, use Gradio (`pip install gradio`) for a quick UI.

- **Deep Research Framework Notes**: Since it's "Claude-style," incorporate iterative reasoning (e.g., multi-turn prompts). If local-only (no API), use Ollama: `ollama run llama3` and integrate via LangChain.

#### Step 3.3: Expose with Ngrok
- Sign up for free at ngrok.com (get auth token).
- Run: `ngrok authtoken your-token`
- Expose: `ngrok http 8001` (or your app's port). It gives a URL like https://abc123.ngrok-free.app.
- **Options**: For static URL, upgrade to paid ($5/month). If multi-port (e.g., separate for DB and app), use ngrok config file for multiple tunnels.

#### Step 3.4: Add Security
- **Basic Auth**: As in Docker env varâ€”require token in queries (e.g., header: Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token).
- **Rate Limiting**: Add to FastAPI with `slowapi` (`pip install slowapi`): Limit to 10 queries/min per IP for your small user group.
- **Options**: For advanced, use JWT if users need accounts; otherwise, share a single API key via email.

### 4. Testing and Usage
- **Local Test**: Curl `http://localhost:8001/query -d '{"text": "Test query"}'`.
- **Public Test**: Share Ngrok URL with users. Instruct: Use Postman or a simple form to POST queries.
- **Monitoring**: Check Docker logs (`docker logs chroma-server`) and app console. For feedback, add a /feedback endpoint.
- **User Onboarding**: Create a quick GitHub README or Google Doc: "Visit [ngrok-url]/query with your question to explore texts directly."

### 5. Potential Issues and Troubleshooting
- **Mac Sleep/Offline**: Use Caffeine app to keep Mac awake, or schedule wake-ups.
- **Ngrok Limits**: Free tier disconnects after 2 hours; restart as needed. Paid fixes this.
- **Performance**: For slow queries, optimize embeddings (e.g., smaller chunks) or add caching.
- **Data Size**: If 30M words overload memory, split collections or use Chroma's compression options.
- **Alternatives if Stuck**: If ngrok flakes, try LocalTunnel (`npm install -g localtunnel; lt --port 8001`) as a free backup.

### 6. Scaling Notes for 10-20 Users
This setup handles light traffic fineâ€”expect <1s latency per query. If users love it, monitor with `htop` and migrate to Option 2. Cost: Truly $0 unless you upgrade ngrok.

There you goâ€”a plug-and-play spec! Paste this into Cursor, tweak the code for your exact prototype, and fire it up. If it breaks or you share more context (e.g., your agent code snippet), hit me backâ€”I've debugged worse in my bootstrapping days. Let's get those users testing! ðŸš€
