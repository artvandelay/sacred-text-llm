# Clean Architecture Summary

This document summarizes the refactored architecture that properly follows our agreed principles.

## Core Principles (What We Fixed)

1. **✅ Isolation**: Modes are now completely self-contained
2. **✅ Minimal Core**: `app/agent/core.py` reduced from 718 lines to 10 lines (just comments)
3. **✅ One File Logic**: All mode logic contained within each mode file
4. **✅ No Router**: Simple mode selection via registry
5. **✅ Minimal Code**: Entry points reduced to ~130 and ~250 lines
6. **✅ DRY**: Single mode registry shared between CLI and web

## Architecture Overview

agent_chat.py                # Thin CLI dispatcher
deploy/web_app.py            # Thin web dispatcher
scripts/                     # Dev/legacy scripts (chat, query, new_mode)
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Self-Contained Modes
Each mode (`deep_research.py`, `contemplative.py`) contains:
- All its own logic
- Its own prompts (NOT in config)
- Its own search implementation
- Complete independence from other modes

### 2. Minimal Entry Points
Both `agent_chat.py` and `deploy/web_app.py` are now thin dispatchers that:
- Load the requested mode from registry
- Run the query through the mode
- Display/stream the results
- Nothing more

### 3. Shared Registry
`app/modes/registry.py` provides:
- Single `MODES` dict used by both CLI and web
- `get_mode()` function with alias support
- `list_modes()` for help displays

### 4. True Generator Pattern
All modes follow the contract:
```python
def run(self, query: str, chat_history: Optional[List[Dict]] = None) -> Generator[Dict[str, Any], None, str]:
    yield {"type": "update", "content": "..."}  # Intermediate updates
    return "Final response"                      # Final response
```

## Testing the Architecture

```bash
# CLI modes
python agent_chat.py --list-modes
python agent_chat.py --mode deep_research --query "What is wisdom?"
python agent_chat.py --mode contemplative --query "What is kindness?"
python agent_chat.py  # Interactive with mode switching

# Original interfaces (still work)
python chat.py        # Simple chat
python query.py "test"  # One-shot query

# Web interface
python deploy/web_app.py
# Visit http://localhost:8001
```

## Adding New Modes

1. Create `app/modes/your_mode.py`:
```python
from app.modes.base import BaseMode
from app.modes.config import YOUR_MODE_CONFIG

class YourMode(BaseMode):
    def run(self, query: str, chat_history=None):
        # ALL logic here, including prompts
        yield {"type": "planning", "content": "Thinking..."}
        
        # Do your thing
        response = "Your response"
        
        return response
```

2. Add config to `app/modes/config.py`:
```python
YOUR_MODE_CONFIG = {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    # Settings ONLY, no prompts!
}
```

3. Register in `app/modes/registry.py`:
```python
from app.modes.your_mode import YourMode

MODES = {
    # ... existing modes ...
    "your_mode": {
        "class": YourMode,
        "description": "What your mode does",
        "aliases": ["ym", "your"]
    }
}
```

That's it! The mode is now available in both CLI and web interfaces.

## What We Learned

1. **Be Paranoid**: Check ALL principles, not just the one mentioned
2. **Actually Refactor**: Don't leave 700-line classes lying around
3. **Keep It Simple**: Entry points should be thin dispatchers
4. **DRY Matters**: Don't duplicate registries between interfaces
5. **Self-Contained**: Modes should truly stand alone
